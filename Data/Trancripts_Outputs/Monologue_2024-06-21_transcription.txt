the job.
Glad to see things are going well and business is starting to pick up.
Andrea told me about your outstanding numbers on Tuesday.
Keep up the good work.
Now to other business.
I am gonna suggest a payment schedule
for the outstanding monies that is due.
One, can you pay the balance of the license agreement as soon as possible?
Two, I suggest we set up or you suggest which you can pay on the back royalties
what do you feel comfortable with paying every two weeks every month I would like to keep I would like to catch up
and maintain current royalties so if we can start current royalties and maintain them every two weeks as all stores are required to do I would appreciate it let me know if this works for you
Thanks.
